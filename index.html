The foundations set by this class would cause me to fall in love with computer programming, and Python remains my best language to this day.</p>

                        <p class="openable-text">While I was learning the ropes of computer programming, I also enrolled in my first New Media course in the Spring 2019 semester. At the time, I was a History student enrolling into electives. I would fall so deeply in love with these courses that I ended up entirely switching my major just a year later. This course taught me the fundamentals of many things, such as Graphic Design, Video Editing, and most importantly, web design with HTML.</p>

                        <p class="openable-text">The very first thing I learned in my first New Media course was how to use Adobe Photoshop. While I had some background in Photoshop from high school, I had never seriously considered it as a career choice until now. I quickly picked up both softwares. While the original images I created during this class are particularly poor by my standards today, I still value them as the places where I learned my fundamentals.</p>
                        <p class="openable-text">The first of these projects I created for this course was to create an image that communicated the idea of <i>Planned Obsolescence</i>. As we had a fair amount of old electronics in the house, I assembled a number of these old items into a pile and photographed them. I then used Photoshop to replace the blank screens within the image with advertisements for many of the modern counterparts of the items shown. While the image quality is relatively poor, it served as my first major project.</p>

As such, our second assignment was a poster based on a quote from her literary work <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. Once again, I developed this in Photoshop, but I approached this project using newly learned techniques such as the use of color adjustment and Photoshop's shading tools. This poster turned out incredibly well, and I am still happy with it today.</p>

                        <p class="openable-text">While the original website is now gone, this was my first-ever foray into the world of website design and development. Being a first-year course taught by a professor who was not as familiar with web design as others, this website is by most standards quite poorly assembled, using multiple techniques that are often considered bad form (such as the use of table elements for spacing). Being my first attempt at creating a website however, it taught me the basics of how HTML is structured and put me on the path to furthering my career in web design.

                        <p class="openable-text">During the 2020 Spring Semeseter in the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I took my first web development course. This class taught the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as how to use the Content Management System Wordpress. While I had briefly touched on HTML and CSS in my first New Media course, this one taught me multiple good practices as well as many more of the fundamental concepts in webpage creation. It also indirectly taught me many skills that would go on to become more useful to me later on, such as the fundamentals of working in databases like MySQL as well as working remotely with Linux servers to deploy hosted content.</p>

                        <p class="openable-text">During the summer of 2020, I spent a fair amount of time out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and began to experiment with programming again in my free time. After a few months of learning some of the more advanced concepts of Python as well as programmatically interacting with the Internet (via REST APIs and websockets), I created my first Discord bot. Named "Kaiser" at the suggestion of a friend, the bot could accept and respond to a basic set of commands regarding time-zone conversion. This experience proved fundamental to my initial understanding of how programs interacted with one another over the internet, and became a major part of my core skillset.</p>
                        <image class="openable-img" src="rsc/web-2.png" alt="Discord Bot Code"></image>
                        <p class="openable-text">In hindsight, I made many mistakes with this bot, but also learned from them. While the use of .json to store all of the bot's data originally seemed like a good idea, in practice it proved slow with large data sets. In addition, my code lacked modularity, making it significantly harder to expand as the project got larger. However, it worked well for my first project, teaching me important skills about how data is retrieved and set around the world using the Internet. While the bot itself is no longer updated due to a lack of time on my part as well as the depreciation of a critical module, I have maintained its source code <a class="openable-link" href="https://github.com/LunarEcklipse/KaiserBot/">here.</a></p>

                        <p class="openable-text">With the return to classes in Fall 2020 being entirely online, I spent my Fall 2020 semester studying certain missing electives as I had just finalized my switch to the New Media program. In Spring 2021 however, I took a class on intermediate graphic design. This course taught me many skills, such as techniques related to the layout of informational graphics and posters, as well as the study of typography, where I reviewed the font Bebas Neue. I produced many graphics for this class as assignments, and the new skills I learned greatly improved the quality of my designs.</p>

                        <p class="openable-text">While courses were being offered online, I took my first dedicated programming course. Using C++, I learned many fundamental concepts in this class, such as the use of compilers as well as Object-Oriented Programming techniques. The knowledge I gained in this class has been the foundations of my modern-day success with computer programming.</p>
                        <p class="openable-text">For the class's final project, we were required to design an interactive program using C++ to demonstrate the concepts we had learned. As I had been working in a restaurant at the time, I designed a command-line-based POS (Point-Of-Sale) terminal which could accept commands to create, modify, and complete orders with customized lists of items. While not as advanced as my earlier Python projects as well as my modern-day work, the code was significantly better formed in comparison, utilizing Object-Oriented patterns and a properly structured event loop. The command line was surprisingly robust and able to efficiently process multiple different commands. While I have since learned that my original code had security flaws, I still believe it shows how I had developed an understanding of important programming fundamentals, especially given that C++ is notorious for its level of difficulty.</p>

Being my first real design project I was admittedly nervous, but after a few days of work on the design I returned a spectacular final product. Designed in Adobe Illustrator, special attention was given to the layering and colorization of the card. The client was impressed by the card, and has asked me if I could continue to update the card so they can continue to use its design.</p>

Over the course of the summer, I decided to learn <i>Flask</i>, a Python framework for creating web servers that can serve dynamic content. While I was learning the library, a friend of mine came to me asking for help. He wanted a web site where he could upload and display images, but had been having trouble with existing services. Feeling up for a challenge, I constructed <i>Loonbooru</i>, my first properly open-source project. Over the course of the summer, I built this framework entirely from the ground up. While originally only able to serve pre-designated images, I have since added functionality to automatically generate browsing pages, a complex database-interface built entirely from scratch, a complex multi-threaded file uploading paradigm, and the ability to search for collections of images based on multiple parameters, including unique keywords. Loonbooru is easily my most ambitious project ever, and is still in active development.</p>

While the original specifications were only for a template for another developer to complete, I ended up coding the site anyways. It went to several revisions and reworks throughout the semester as I learned more about advanced web design topics, but is now more or less completed. The site's owner has since offered me the opportunity to continue to construct the site and add new functionality as part of a paid contract.</p>
